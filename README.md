A few utility functions that can be used in three.js based project, 
* get 3d object's bounding box size (dimensions),
* get screen size to resize the canvas, where the biggest side is based on some arbitrary value and the other one is derived from it
* deep merge two objects
* apply transformations like position, rotation, scale to a target Object3D
